# BigInteger Library

Welcome to the **BigInteger Library**! This library offers a comprehensive implementation for handling and performing operations on very large integers. Whether you’re working on complex calculations or managing huge numbers, this library is designed to meet your needs.

## Overview

The BigInteger Library is built to handle arbitrarily large integers, providing key functionalities like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Developed in C, it’s both efficient and straightforward to integrate into your projects.

## Features

- **Addition**: Effortlessly add two big integers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract one big integer from another with precision.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply large integers efficiently.
- **Division**: Perform division and obtain accurate results.
- **Modulus**: Compute the modulus of large integers.

## Getting Started

To integrate and use the BigInteger Library in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/BigIntegerLibrary.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd BigIntegerLibrary
    ```

3. **Compile the Code**:
    ```bash
    gcc main.c BigInteger.c -o biginteger
    ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    ./biginteger
    ```

## Usage

Here are some examples to get you started with the BigInteger functions:

### Initializing a BigInteger

To create a BigInteger from a string:
```c
struct BigInteger myBigInt = initialize("12345678901234567890");
```

### Adding Two BigIntegers

To perform addition:
```c
struct BigInteger result = add(bigInt1, bigInt2);
```

### Subtracting Two BigIntegers

To perform subtraction:
```c
struct BigInteger result = sub(bigInt1, bigInt2);
```

### Multiplying Two BigIntegers

To perform multiplication:
```c
struct BigInteger result = mul(bigInt1, bigInt2);
```

### Dividing Two BigIntegers

To perform division:
```c
struct BigInteger result = div1(bigInt1, bigInt2);
```

### Computing Modulus

To calculate the modulus:
```c
struct BigInteger result = mod(bigInt1, bigInt2);
```

## File Structure

Here’s an overview of the project files:

```plaintext
